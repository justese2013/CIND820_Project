# CIND820_Project
CIND820 Project
## Tentative stages of the project
Processing – This stage will involve the following steps, the initial analysis and examination of the data to know the size and type of the data, we will look at the number of variables and observations, check for duplicate entries if any. We will also convert object data types to character data type and then process an EDA (Exploratory data analysis report). EDA analysis will plot bar charts of the counts of non- numerical variables and plot box plot for numerical data to show the data distribution and check for outliers.
Train/ Test Dataset – Character data type will will hot- coded first before data set will be split into training, 70% and test 30%. Class column will be Duration of Unemployment.
Feature extraction - Two features will be dropped, 'Year' and 'Geography' as they have no significance on the research question.
Naives Bayes - Machile learning carrried out with naive bayes,class label is multiclass confusion matrix shows further need to regroup the class features.
( This will be carried out in the next section)
